### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in the MBA Business Intelligence & Analytics program. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, majoring in Theoretical Physics with a special interest in Astronomy and Mathematics (2015-2020). I have taken advanced courses in Mathematics (ODE, algebra, analysis, statistics, probability, and more), Astrophysics (High Energy Physics, Plasma Physics, Black Hole and Pulsar structures, and more), Non-Linear systems (Network Dynamics, Chaos systems, and more), Complex systems (Neural networks, Market dynamics, and more), Engineering (including engineering design projects), Computer Science, technical/business writing, and economics as well. Recently, I have been heavily involved with Data Science and Machine Learning related projects.
I am highly passionate about research related to applications of Machine Learning in finance and neuroscience. If possible, I would like to continue my education in this field.

Some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an ML project and sharpening my Mathematics skills ðŸ˜„
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Deep Learning, Data Science, and Database languages such as SQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with image processing and advance data visualization.
- ðŸ“« Please feel free to reach out to me for anything related to data science, physics, and physical sciences in general ðŸ˜„: achopra4@stevens.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love old sci-fi movies like Blade Runner, Ghost in a Shell, Matrix, Bicentennial Man, I Robot, A.I., Terminator ðŸ˜¨, and more! ðŸ˜„
