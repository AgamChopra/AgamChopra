### 'Utah Teapot!'
My aim is to understand the dynamics of complex physical systems such as the brain, leveraging modern Machine Learning algorithms. I am also interested in working with Physics-based approaches for Machine Learning and physically constrained optimization algorithms for spiking neurons, inspired by neural pruning in early brain development, that should work with small datasets and fewer iterations.
