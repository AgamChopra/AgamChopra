### 'Utah Teapot!' ->(NMT)-> 'Hello World!'

I am highly passionate about Machine Learning and its applications in understanding Nonlinear dynamics of very complex physical systems such as the brain. This passion also extends into the realms of Artificial General Intelligence and Physics-based approach to solve data-driven problems. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, majoring in Theoretical Physics with a special interest in Astronomy and Mathematics (2015-2020). For a brief period after graduation, I was obsessed with the turbulent flows of the accretion disk around a "feeding" black hole, which led me into a rabbit hole that ended with the applications of solving complex nonlinear systems with a data-driven approach such as deep learning. This is when I decided to learn ML extensively. Currently, I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, pursuing a Master of Science degree in Machine Learning. Recently, I have been heavily involved with Machine Learning related projects through my role as a research assistant at KurtLab and other passion/side projects that can be found on my GitHub profile.
My dream is to research artificial neural nets that accurately mimic abstract brain functions.

Some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing research at KurtLab ðŸ˜„
- ðŸ“« Please feel free to reach out to me for anything related to ML, physics, and physical sciences in general ðŸ˜„: achopra4@stevens.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love old sci-fi movies like Blade Runner, Ghost in a Shell, Matrix, Bicentennial Man, I Robot, A.I., Terminator ðŸ˜¨, and more! ðŸ˜„
