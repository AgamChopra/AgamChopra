### 'Utah Teapot!' ->(NMT)-> 'Hello World!'

I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, pursuing a master’s degree in the MBA Business Intelligence & Analytics program. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, majoring in Theoretical Physics with a special interest in Astronomy and Mathematics (2015-2020). Recently, I have been heavily involved with Data Science and Machine Learning related projects especially in Neuroscience and Neuromechanics.
My dream is to research artificial neural nets that accurately mimic abstract brain functions.

Some things about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently doing research at KurtLab 😄
- 📫 Please feel free to reach out to me for anything related to ML, physics, and physical sciences in general 😄: achopra4@stevens.edu
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love old sci-fi movies like Blade Runner, Ghost in a Shell, Matrix, Bicentennial Man, I Robot, A.I., Terminator 😨, and more! 😄
