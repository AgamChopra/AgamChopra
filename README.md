### 'Utah Teapot!' ->(NMT)-> 'Hello World!'

I am a graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in the MBA Business Intelligence & Analytics program. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree at Purdue University, West Lafayette, majoring in Theoretical Physics with a special interest in Astronomy and Mathematics (2015-2020). Recently, I have been heavily involved with Data Science and Machine Learning related projects especially in Neuroscience and Neuromechanics.
My dream is to research artificial neural nets that accurately mimic abstract brain functions.

Some things about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently doing research at KurtLab for visualizing 3d aMRI displacement fields of the brain using deep learning ðŸ˜„
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with implimenting a 3d-UNET model for predicting 3d displacement fields.
- ðŸ“« Please feel free to reach out to me for anything related to data science, physics, and physical sciences in general ðŸ˜„: achopra4@stevens.edu
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love old sci-fi movies like Blade Runner, Ghost in a Shell, Matrix, Bicentennial Man, I Robot, A.I., Terminator ðŸ˜¨, and more! ðŸ˜„
