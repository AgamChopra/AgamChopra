### 'Utah Teapot!'
My aim is to understand the dynamics of complex physical systems such as the brain, leveraging modern Machine Learning algorithms and computer vision. I am also interested in Physics-based approaches for Machine Learning and physically constrained optimization algorithms inspired by neural pruning in early brain development, that should work with small datasets and fewer iterations.
