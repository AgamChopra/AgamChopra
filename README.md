### 'Utah Teapot!'
I love Physics and Computer Science, and aim to understand complex physical systems such as the brain, leveraging modern Machine Learning algorithms and computer vision. I am also interested in Physics-constrained optimization, biological neural pruning in early brain development, and other methods to improve ML algorithms.
